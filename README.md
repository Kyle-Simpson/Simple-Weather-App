Hello, and welcome to my weather app.  The idea for this application, and much of the code came from fellow GitHub-er Eric Vicenti, whose repo [https://github.com/ericvicenti/intro-to-react/blob/master/README.md] helped me learn more about the practical uses of JavaScript and the React library.  

At the moment, this application can only be run on local machines, and I do not plan to host it on any public servers as it is not incredibly useful outside of being good practice.  That being said, feel free to check out Eric's repo if you are also interested in learning more about the React library.  

Thanks for visiting!
